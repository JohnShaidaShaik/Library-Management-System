Library Management System
Our project simplifies library operations with distinct modules for users and admins. Users can browse and borrow books, while admins manage inventory, issue books, and monitor activities.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for responsive design.
Backend: PHP and MySQL for database management, integrated using XAMPP.
This system ensures efficient library management with a user-friendly interface.
